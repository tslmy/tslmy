## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on multiple **chatbot** projects
  - [StarsRail/Cocai](https://github.com/StarsRail/Cocai) is a chatbot that plays Call of Cthulhu (CoC) with you.
  - [colabear-info/agent](https://github.com/colabear-info/agent) is a group chat where AIs keep discussing and you can interrupt / contribute at any time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to make chatbots interact more humanlike.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any of the chatbot projects mentioned above.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [changing the lightbulb](http://www.inflection-point.com/jokes/50.htm).
- 💬 Ask me about any of the services I provide. They are listed on my homepage, [myli.page](https://https://www.myli.page/).
